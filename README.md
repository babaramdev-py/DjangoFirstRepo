# This project has utilised Django 1.10 as the tech stack on the back end. HTML and BS-5 on the FrontEnd have been implemented.

I have learned quite a lot while working with Logins and Authentication:

1.) I learned how much encryption matters and hashing passwords is super important while working.

2.) I installed independent third party password hashers(using SHA-256)

3.) I learned how the 'USER' model works which is a part of django.contrib.auth

4.) I learned how to link a 'USER' model above to use onetoone link and create a new USER model which is independent of contrib.auth lib.

5.) I learned how to create registrations for a user using POST and GET modulations in views.py.

6.) I learned how to create logins for each user and how to use decorators and built in Python functionality to do so.

7.) I learned how to use the Admin page to my advantage and cross verified the features of Django on the BackEnd
